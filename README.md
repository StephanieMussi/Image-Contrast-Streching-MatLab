# Image_Contrast_Streching_MatLab
This project implements two methods for constrast stretching of images in MatLab.  
The image used can be found in ["mrt-train.jpg"](https://github.com/StephanieMussi/Image_Contrast_Streching_MatLab/blob/main/mrt-train.jpg).  
The image is read and the properties are displayed:  
```matlab
Pc = imread('mrt-train.jpg');
whos Pc
```  

After the image is read
## Linear Contrast Stretching

## Histogram Equalization
